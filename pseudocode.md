As a user with a To-Do list I want to be able to:
    - Add items to a list to remind the user of what they need to do.
    - Remove items as you complete them.
    - switch between views of All items, Active items, Completed Items.(Stretch)


Output box.
If user inputs data and hits enter or clicks a add button
    then add data to list.


List of items
If user has inputted data and it has been added to the list
    then options of Completing and deleting task becomes available. (Stretch)
If user completes task on item, and completed button is used, item is then taken to the completed state.(stretch)
